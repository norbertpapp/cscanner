For example, if you want to make sure that your port 22 is never open to the world, across all your cloud providers, you could do something like this: connections: # Configure your connections here rules: - type: FIREWALL_PUBLIC_SERVICE_PROHIBITED protocol: tcp ports: - 22 You would then get a report detailing all your security groups across all your cloud providers and if they are compliant or are violating the rules. Downloading You can grab one of the releases from GitHub. Running To run the cscanner, simply point it to your config file: java -jar cscanner.jar your-config-file.yaml Make sure you have at least Java 8 to run this application. Configuring The cloud scanner is configured using YAML files. The yaml files have two sections: connections and rules . The layout looks roughly like this: --- connections: # Cloud provider connections go here rules: # Compliance rules go here In connections you configure your various cloud accounts, such as this: exoscale-test: type: exoscale key: secret: The respective options for each cloud provider are documented in their documentation. The connection name can then referenced with the rules. The next section is the rules section, which you can specify your rules in: - type: FIREWALL_PUBLIC_SERVICE_PROHIBITED protocol: tcp ports: - 22 Each rule has two universal parameters: type to specify the rule type and connections which you can use to limit the rule to only certian connections. The default is to use all connections. If a certain cloud provider doesn't support a specific functionality, that cloud provider will be simply skipped for the specified rule. Supported cloud providers Currently the following cloud providers are supported: Amazon Web Services Exoscale Supported rules Currently the following rule sets are supported: Firewall S3 Compiling If you want to compile the utility from source, you will need Maven . Using Maven and at least a JDK compatible with Java 8 you should be able to simply run mvn package to compile the source code and then find the compiled binaries in cli/target .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#cscanner-a-cloud-security-scanner","text":"This utility is intended to check your cloud configuration for compliance with your companies rules in an automated fashion, not unlike AWS config.

Before you jump in, please keep in mind that CScanner is a very young project and the APIs have not yet stabilized. Before you jump in and write some code, make sure to open an issue with your proposal or jump on Discord so you can receive adequate support for doing so. What to contribute There is a great need for cloud provider implementations as well as new rule sets. However, please refrain (for now) from contributing on-premises providers such as VMWare, because there is no affordable infrastructure to run CScanner automated tests against. Setting up your development environment. In order to write code for CScanner you will need three things: A Java 8 JDK. Any will do, but OpenJDK is preferred. Maven. This is our dependency manager. An account with the cloud provider you want to work with. It is also recommended that you use an IDE as Java is not the easiest language to work with if you don't have one. The project is built with IntelliJ IDEA, but any will do. Building the project The project can be built with a simple mvn package . However, keep in mind that some tests depend on a cloud provider configuration to be available, which will be documented at a later stage. Please open an issue or go on Discord to receive some help in setting this up. (Yes, this will be improved later on.)

CScanner is a very young project and the internal API has not yet stabilized. It is recommended that you contact the author before starting to write a rule or provider to coordinate efforts. Integrating a new provider is quite a challenging task as you will need to decide which rules you want to support. First off you start with your provider class: public class YourCloudProvider implements CloudProvider YourConfiguration, YourConnection { } Additionally, you will want to look into each of the rules what additional classes you can implement , such as S3CloudProvider YourConfiguration, YourConnection or FirewallCloudProvider YourConfiguration, YourConnection . These interfaces are used when walking through the cloud accounts to determine which cloud supports which rules. The configuration class Next up, you will need to write your configuration class: public class YourConfiguration { @Nullable public final String key; @Nullable public final String secret; public YourConfiguration( @Nullable String key, @Nullable String secret ) { this.key = key; this.secret = secret; } } This is very plain and simple and only serves to store the configuration relevant to your cloud provider. This configuration class will be filled in your cloud provider class later. The connection class The third thing you need to create is a connection class like so: public class YourConnection implements CloudProviderConnection { private final String name; private final YourConfiguration configuration; public YourConnection( String name, YourConfiguration configuration ) { this.name = name; this.configuration = configuration; } @Override public String getConnectionName() { return name; } } Based on what your cloud provider will support, you will need to implement additional classes, such as S3Connection and you will need to implement the methods relevant to that interface too, such as returning an S3 client based on your configuration. Reading the configuration Now we have reached the point to implement some functions in our cloud provider class, most importantly reading the configuration. You will receive the configuration for your provider as a Map String, Object . Keep in mind that the configuration comes from a YAML, JSON, etc file so it is your responsibility to vet the content and make sure you have the correct data types. For example public class YourCloudProvider implements CloudProvider YourConfiguration, YourConnection { @Override public YourConnection getConnection( String name, Map String, Object configuration ) { YourConfiguration configObject = new YourConfiguration( (String) configuration.getOrDefault( key , null), (String) configuration.getOrDefault( secret , null) ); return new YourConnection(name, configObject); } } Writing a plugin Finally, you will need to write a plugin. This is quite simple: @ParametersAreNonnullByDefault public class YourPlugin implements Plugin { @Override public List CloudProvider ?, ? getCloudProviders() { return Arrays.asList( new YourCloudProvider() ); } } You will need to add this client to the cli module as at this time there is no automatic plugin discovery.","title":"Writing a Provider"},{"location":"development/provider/#writing-a-provider","text":"The API may change!

CScanner is a very young project and the internal API has not yet stabilized. It is recommended that you contact the author before starting to write a rule or provider to coordinate efforts. Writing a rule is a lot less well described than writing a provider as each rule has its very own implementation. For this example we will stick with an S3 implementation for various cloud providers. Writing a rule class First of all, we are going to write our actual rule class: public class MyS3Rule implements Rule S3Connection { public final static String RULE = S3_MY_RULE ; //This is a parameter that comes from the configuration private final boolean scanContents; public MyS3Rule( boolean scanContents ) { this.scanContents = scanContents; } @Override public List RuleResult evaluate(S3Connection s3Connection) { //Evaluate rules here and respond with a list of results.

This is an interface that will let you retrieve the actual S3 client. public interface S3Connection extends CloudProviderConnection { AmazonS3 getS3Client(); } This connection will be injected to the evaluate call for each connection that needs to be checked. Keep in mind though that some implementations may be more complicated as the cloud resource may be, for example, bound to a region that you need to handle. Writing a rule builder In order for the system to be able to construct the rule with the appropriate parameters, you will also need a rule builder like so: public class MyS3RuleBuilder implements RuleBuilder S3PublicReadProhibitedRule, S3Connection { @Override public String getType() { return S3PublicReadProhibitedRule.RULE; } @Override public Class S3Connection getConnectionType() { return S3Connection.class; } @Override public MyS3Rule create(Map String, Object options) { //return the configured rule here. } } Writing a plugin Finally you will need to write a plugin to load the rule.
